- Matching Results Display: Display the matching results, highlighting matched strings and providing captured groups with one-click copy functionality.
- Regex Replacement: Implement a replace function with a text input for the replacement string, supporting group substitution like $1, $2, etc., and displaying real-time replacement results with a one-click copy function.
- Visualization Display: Visualize the regular expression structure graphically, showing groups, quantifiers, character classes, etc.
- Data Generation: Utilize a tool to generate sample data automatically that matches the current regular expression.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Dark blue (#3F51B5) for a professional and focused feel.
- Background color: Light gray (#EEEEEE) for a clean, readable workspace.
- Accent color: Orange (#FF9800) to highlight important interactive elements such as the matching results or data generation options.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', a sans-serif font, for a modern and readable interface.
- Code font: 'Source Code Pro' for the regular expression input area and displaying code snippets.
- Use clear and simple icons from a library like FontAwesome to represent regex options and functions (e.g., a magnifying glass for search, a document for copy).
- Divide the layout into logical sections: Regex Input, Test String Input, Matching Results, Replacement, Visualization. Use tabs or expandable sections for organization.
